# Diagnoz

Diagnoz, is implemented as a web application using Django, a popular Python web
framework. The application is designed to predict the likelihood of several diseases,
including diabetes, heart disease, liver disease, breast cancer, and malaria. The prediction
model for each disease is built using machine learning algorithms, with a neural networkbased image model used for the malaria prediction. And random forest algorithm is used for
the rest of the diseases
